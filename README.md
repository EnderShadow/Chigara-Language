# Chigara-Language

OUTDATED: Expect an updated version of the code at a later date.

Just something I thought I'd make that has the benefits of Java as well as a couple other languages. Feel free make an issue suggesting a new feature or change to the existing language.

Ignore Compiler.java and CompilerCore.java for now.
